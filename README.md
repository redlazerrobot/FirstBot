These are the files to a disocrd bot I made, here is it's !help command:
Hello! This bot is mainly for automatically responding to messages. I respond to 'What's popping?', "
'Big brain', 'Imposter',and some words that are emojis. Here is some commands that I can do:
!wordfight - A game that whoever types a random letter first wins.
!inspire - Get some inspiration from quotes.
!help - Get information about this bot, this command.
This bot also has a chat bot feature if you type in a specific channel, which's ID you need to put in which uses AI to recognize things like greetings and respond accordingly.

This bot is not a perfect, but you can use as a template if you wish.
NOTES:
This code uses neuralintents which uses tensorflow which at the moment supports python 3.7 - 3.9. If you are using a version that doesn't work, then download a python version that does work on python.org and make a python interperter with that in a python IDE. The intents.json fie is for the AI to recognize messages and send a respond that makes sense, all you have to do for it to recognize something like goodbyes, you would provide examples of goodbyes in patterns. The AI will take that pattern and will be able to recognize goodbyes that you didn't type in. The responses will stay static, but it will randomly pick from the responses you gave.
